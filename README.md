## Tracking my progress on #365papers

R code to log my progress on #365papers:

1. Reads in data from a google spreadsheet, which automagically logs new #365papers entries each time I tweet (using IFTTT)

2. Data tidied using *tidyr*

3. Some basic graphs plotted to show progress towards target, and diurnal and weekly patterns to tweets.

![Diurnal](diurnal-hist.png =250x)

![Diurnal](weekly-hist.png =250x)

![Diurnal](cumulative.png =250x)
